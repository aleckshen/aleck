                I'm a second year computer science major studying at the University<br>
                of Auckland. I enjoy problem solving and I'm passionate about coding<br>
                in my free time.

            Some of my hobbies outside of computer science involve bouldering,<br>
            gyming and running. In my free time I enjoy listening to music, eating<br>
            with friends and going on spontaneous trips.

            Hello, my name is Aleck and I'm currently a second year student studying at the University of Auckland.<br>
            I love creative arts, whether it be graphics design, photography, cinematography or even painting. In my<br>
            spare time, I enjoy creating graphic designs and am eager to deepen my skills by combining my creativity <br>
            with my knowledge of software development. I love spending time outside of home, often going on hikes, <br>
            random trips and eating food with my friends!<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are some photos of my life!
