            Hello, my name is Aleck. I'm currently a second year student studying at the University of Auckland.<br>
            I love creative arts, whether it be graphics design, photography, cinematography or even painting. In my<br>
            spare time, I enjoy creating graphic designs and am eager to deepen my skills by combining my creativity <br>
            with my knowledge of software development. I love spending time outside of home, often going on hikes, <br>
            random trips and eating food with my friends!<br>
